tkit stands for topology kit.
It's for making selections based on what's already selected.

Per Vertex, Edge, or Face, selecting what might be termed ``Neighboring elements``

Also two other functions that reduce edge selection to either ``inner`` edges or ``just`` the edges.

Plus one Conway's Life Algorithm that works in face selection mode.
