tkit?

tkit stands for topology kit.

I had been calling it 'topokit', but tkit is fewer letters.

topology kit?

yes.

It's for making a selection based on what's selected.

Neighbors, of sorts.

Where applicable, there's a version that includes existing selection and one that only selects the resulting set of neighbors.

The ones that include existing selection function as simple growth -- mostly identical to what ctrl+ and ctrl- do already.


Play around with it a little bit, and you might find some of these functions useful for UV-seaming.  By no means is this project finished.  I haven't submitted it to bf-extensions basically because 

A) i can't figure out how or exactly where out of the multitude of apparently outdated sites blender development is actually taking place.  THe place i logged in and created an account looked like it hadn't been touched since 2.4x days, and the internets are pretty slow out here, so you know how that is.

and

B)  its just not ready yet.  in the spirit doing all the various operations according to some standard pattern, some of these things got severely DE-optimised.  It's not slow, just naive.  I'm planning on using the foreach getters and setters next, so really large meshes can be processed.  But hey, I thought…" Why not see if there's any super-coders out there that could show me how they would do it?  or maybe write it in C? Heck, why not assembly lol no well i can wish in one hand and type with the other, right?
