#tkit

This blender addon provides several hotkey mappings to operators which
are for selecting edges in edit mode.

* ie ``'``  
* oe ``"``  
* lon ``]``  
* lun ``[``  
* ef1n ``\``  
* ef2n ``|``  
* ef2np ``Control+|``  
* ef2nx ``Control+Alt+|``  
* epz ``Control+Alt+Shift+End``

There is a help operator to tell you all of this within blender.  Use
spacebar-menu and search for 'tkit help', and this hotkey chart will be
displayed in the active tool region.
