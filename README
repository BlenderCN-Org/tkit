tkit stands for topology kit.
It's for making selections based on what's already selected.

Per Vertex, Edge, or Face, selecting what might be termed ``Neighboring elements``

Also two other functions that reduce edge selection to either ``inner`` edges or ``just`` the edges.

Plus one Conway's Life Algorithm that works in face selection mode.

[INSTALLATION]

1.  If you're reading this at github, which you probably are, then click the ``Downloads`` button up there.

2.  Decompress the file and place the resulting folder inside your addons folder.

3.  Enable ``Topokit`` in blender's User Preferences > Addons.

[USAGE]

Having a mesh object selected in edit mode, the W key brings up the mesh specials menu.  If the add-on enabled correctly, you should see ``Topokit`` at the bottom of that menu.

If you prefer buttons instead of the specials menu, use the N key in the 3d View to show the right-side properties pane.  There is an option to put some buttons in the tools panel.  You can bring up the tools panel by pressing the T key in the 3d view.

If you hold shift while clicking one of the ``neighbor`` functions, that will cause the operator to extend the selection instead of replacing it.
For the most part, this results in simple growth ( first three of the five ``neighbor`` functions.)
However, its actually useful on the last two ( Lateral and Longitudinal edges ) if you don't want skipping.

[roadmap for the coming week]

conway's life to affect and play with material index ( no it just plays with selection )

face neighbors gets re-factored to faces ``sharing`` X  where X is  either vertices or edges.

modal operation -- this will solve the issue i have with wanting to cache ``the maps`` and only update when the mesh changes.
