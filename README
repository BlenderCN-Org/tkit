tkit stands for topology kit.

It's for making selections based on what's already selected.

Per Vertex, Edge, or Face, selecting what might be termed ``Neighboring elements``

Also two other functions that reduce edge selection to either ``inner`` edges or ``just`` the edges.

Plus one Conway's Life Algorithm that works in face selection mode.

[INSTALLATION if you don't just fork it]

1.  If you're reading this at github, which you probably are, then click the ``Downloads`` button and choose tar.gz or zip.

2.  When you decompress the file you downloaded, you'll get a folder which you should inside your addons folder.

3.  Enable ``Topokit`` in blender's User Preferences > Addons.

[USAGE]

Having a mesh object selected in edit mode, the W key brings up the mesh specials menu.  If the add-on enabled correctly, you should see ``Topokit`` at the bottom of that menu.

If prefer buttons, open the 3d view properties (with the N key) and look for ``topokit settings``.   There's a box you can check to toggle some buttons.  They will show up in the left-side ``tools`` pane, during edit mode.

Holding [shift] while clicking any one of the ``Neighbors`` functions will extend the selection instead of replacing it.

[roadmap for next week]

conway's life should play with material index as well as with selection.

modal operation -- will solve the issue I have with wanting to ``cache`` the maps in-between calls and only update when mesh data changes.

face neighbors gets refactored into select faces ``sharing X`` where X is either vertices or faces.

optimize with foreach_getters/setters,  undo more foolish cruft, comment code.
