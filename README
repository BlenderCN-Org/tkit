tkit stands for topology kit.

It's for making selections based on what's already selected.

Per Vertex, Edge, or Face, selecting what might be termed ``Neighboring elements``

Also two other functions that reduce edge selection to either ``inner`` edges or ``just`` the edges.

Plus one Conway's Life Algorithm that works in face selection mode.

[INSTALLATION]

1.  If you're reading this at github, which you probably are, then click the ``Downloads`` button and choose tar.gz or zip.

2.  When you decompress the file you downloaded, you'll get a folder which you should place inside your addons folder.

3.  Enable ``Topokit`` in blender's User Preferences > Addons.

[USAGE]

Having a mesh object selected in edit mode, the W key brings up the mesh specials menu.  If the add-on enabled correctly, you should see ``Topokit`` at the bottom of that menu.

If prefer buttons, open the 3d view properties (with the N key) and look for ``topokit settings``.   There's a box you can check to toggle some buttons.  They will show up in the left-side ``tools`` pane, during edit mode.

Holding [shift] while clicking any one of the ``Neighbors`` functions will extend the selection instead of replacing it.

[roadmap]

conway's life should play with material index as well as with selection, and have some way to animate.  (I think that keyframing user-properties probably works now in 2.59)  I was fail in 2.58 and haven't looked into it since.

modal operation -- will solve the issue I have with wanting to ``cache`` the maps in-between calls and only update when mesh data changes.

face neighbors probably refactored into ``select faces sharing X`` where X is either vertices or faces.

optimize with foreach_getters/setters,  undo more foolish cruft, comment code.

a tkit_utils panel, with macros for any of blender's ops that might relate to the business of ``topology``,  just for the sake of gathering it all in one place (even though the spacebar menu is better, its sometimes to SEE buttons.)

and for the sake of being retro -- an attempt to recreate some of that pre-2.5 horizontal buttons panel goodness.  just a matter of layout, that.
